# CS168 Introduction to the Internet: Architecture and Protocols
In this course I learned about the Internet's scalability and robustness and about protocols and algorithms used in the Internet architecture. These include layering, addressing, intra-domain routing, inter-domain routing, TCP, UDP, IP, ARP, and DNS.
## proj1-Distance-Vector-Routing
This project was implementing distance vector routing in a toy network. I constructed forwarding tables and peer tables to determine packet forwarding. I also implemented poisoned reverse and route poisoning to enhance the routing algorithm.
## proj2-TCP-Transport
This project was implementing TCP in a toy network. I conducted TCP by reading flags of received packets and by setting flags on sent packets.
