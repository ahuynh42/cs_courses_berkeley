For me, one of the hard parts was just struggling through how to use functions like telnet and tcpdump properly. After that the rest of the project went pretty well. The amount of coding in this project was pretty light compared to other projects I’ve done in cs classes which I appreciate. I liked how the methods we would need to use, especially send_pkt and get_pkt, were given to us and all I had to do was just call them when I needed to send and get packets. Something that was very annoying was having to wait a few minutes after everytime I interacted with the firewall. Of course there’s nothing anyone can do about that.
