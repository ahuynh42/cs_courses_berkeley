# CS161 Computer Security
In this course I learned about cryptography, security vulnerabilities, and network security. These include encryption, authentication, hash functions, cryptographic protocols, and firewalls.
## proj1-Security-Vulnerabilities
This project was exploiting four security vulnerabilities to gain access to various toy servers. The vulnerabilities were memory related.
## proj1_submit
The submitted files for this project. It contains descriptions and methods used to complete parts of the project.
## proj2-Secure-File-Store
This project was creating a file store that protects data from attackers. I used CFB encryption, RSA signing, and MACs to encrypt and verify the file store. I also implemented file sharing with public key cryptography using RSA encryption.
## proj3-Great-Firewall-of-China
This project was interacting with China's Internet firewall, commonly known as the Great Firewall of China. The intent was to learn about firewalls and to try to bypass it.
