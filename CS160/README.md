# CS160 User Interface Design and Development
In this course I learned how to design, prototype, and evaluate user interfaces. I also gained experience making a simple Android app and two Alexa skills.
## design_final-Sleep-Aid-Alexa-Skill
This is a journal based sleep aid Alexa skill that helps a user fall asleep. In a team of four, I helped design and prototype this skill. I wrote the back-end code for the skill in AWS, Amazon Web Services. We used Amazon's server to register voice inputs and perform appropriate actions.
## proj_01-Calorie-Calculator-Android
This is a calculator app that converts an amount of exercise to Calories burned. This was an introductory project to designing a user interface. I took user input, performed appropriate calculations, and displayed the results. I also implemented vertical and horizontal layouts for the app.
## proj_02-First-Aid-Alexa-Skill
This is a first aid Alexa skill that can give instructions on how to do CPR. This was an introductory project to using Alexa and AWS, Amazon Web Services. I used intents and utterances to register speech and perform appropriate actions.
